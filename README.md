# Yale Alarm System Node.js API Wrapper

This Node.js module wraps the undocumented API used to control the [Yale Smart Alarm System](https://www.yale.co.uk/en/yale/couk/products/smart-living/smart-home-alarms/smart-home-alarm-and-view-kit/).

## Installation

`npm i yalealarmsystem --save`

## Usage

### getSessionCookie

`getSessionCookie` will retrive a cookie to use for the API, it takes two arguments, your username and password used to login to the App of your alarm system. 

```
getSessionCookie('username', 'password');
```

### getStatus

`getStatus` will retrieve the status of the alarm system, it returns the JSON response the API returns. 

```
getStatus('sessionCookie');
```

As the example shows you will need to pass the sessionCookie into the getStatus method call, as this module is promise based you can simply chain the getStatus method call after your getSessionCookie call.

```
getSessionCookie('username', 'password').then(getStatus);
```

### setStatus

`setStatus` will set the status of the alarm system. It takes two parameters:

* Session Cookie - This is retrieved using `getSessionCookie`
* Mode - The mode can either be 'arm', 'home' or 'disarm'

```
setStatus('sessionCookie', 'arm');
```

As the example shows you will need to pass the sessionCookie into the setStatus method call, as this module is promise based you can simply chain the setStatus method call after your getSessionCookie call.

```
getSessionCookie('username', 'password').then((sessionCookie) => {
    setStatus(sessionCookie, 'arm');
});
```
